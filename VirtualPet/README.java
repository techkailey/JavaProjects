Homework 3

For my program I used a puplic class and imported Scanner for user input.

The program is a Virtual Pet game.
In the beginning of the program, the user will be asked to input a name for the pet.
Then they have to take care of the pet. After a certain amount of days the values of the attributes 
(dirtiness, boredom, and hunger) will decrease, resulting in the game to be more of a challenge. If 
the values reach below a certain value the pet will run away. The user is told what 
values are low to prevent the puppy from running away. They are also informed that because 
they puppy has reached a certain age they will need to do more for it. If the puppy does 
run away, a reason will be given. 

There are no bugs that I have found.
